# Node-js-shell
Node js shell is a little shell (quite a awefull shell really) written in javascript that runs on the node.js platform. It was for one of my projects for Principals of programming languages.

## How to use:

On a shell: Execute 

```
$nodejs nsh.js
```
If all works it should boot up and run. If you are using windows you might have to execute node rather than nodejs.

## What I put here:

* The mp3 audio report.
* The powerpoint I presented in class.
* The two files, nsh.js and child.js.

Have fun and don't blow up your system; this is a fully functional (although not really well functioning) shell. It can execute anything bash can execute because it simply sends the commands on to the opperating systems shell.
